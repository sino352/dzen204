Known issues of this release:

 - FFmpeg/FLAC don't work yet - this means you can only use ogg audio.
   The according sections in README or Ship-your-game.txt or other places
   mentioning those features are preliminary. Please wait for the next
   release for FFmpeg/FLAC support.

 - Physics support is incomplete and doesn't support collision callbacks,
   hinges/skeletons or collision masking yet.

 - The Android port is in a pretty incomplete and not really usable state.
